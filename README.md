# Kanban-Board
A kanban board using the React Native JavaScript framework, the Redux JavaScript library, and Expo.

**Create a new branch!!!!!!**

## To-Do Items

* Create an app called `Kanban Board` using 
    * Redux (See this [documentation](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) to add it to the app.), 
    * React Native, 
    * and Expo.
* In it's own repo.
* Something simple. No api calls. etc.

1. Start with a to-do list where

    a. you can make multiple lists, 

    b. add items to each of them, 
    
    c. delete items from each of them.

2. When that is successful, then create a "Trello" board.

## Next Steps

* Create a `ListItemComponents` branch.

* Create a `List` component and an `Item` component.

* Delete the `gitignore` branch.

* Delete the `ListItemComponents` branch.

* Populate them with `props`.

* Populate them with `state`.

* By the time Redux is loaded make sure the file structure is:
```
- root directory
    -src
        -js
            -actions
            -components
            -constants
            -middleware
            -reducers
            -store
```

## Status

* Created a `gitignore` branch so that a comprehensive .gitignore file can be added to this repo.

* Attempting to get the List component to load once the button is selected.

* Followed along with three tutorials.
See individual [Directory](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/Libraries/Redux#directories) for status.
